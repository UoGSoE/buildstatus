# Developer Notes

## Project Overview
This is a proof-of-concept Laravel/Livewire application for monitoring lab machine build statuses across multiple university labs. The approach is to spike out functionality first to understand the domain, then backfill with comprehensive tests once the design is more confident.

## Session Summary (2025-10-07)

### What We Accomplished

1. **SimulateApiUpdates Command**
   - Implemented `app:simulate-api-updates` artisan command for local development and demos
   - Accepts `--number` option (defaults to 5) to specify how many machines to update
   - Uses `Machine::inRandomOrder()->take($number)->get()` to select random machines
   - Dispatches `MachineUpdate` jobs synchronously via `dispatchSync()` (no queue worker required)
   - Includes 14 plausible status updates: Building, Installing Updates, Configuring, Ready, Pending Restart, In Maintenance, Provisioning, Failed, Imaging, Testing, Deploying Applications, Awaiting Approval, Offline, Online
   - Provides clear console feedback showing each machine update
   - Handles edge cases: validates number >= 1, checks for empty machine list

### Key Design Decisions

#### Why dispatchSync()?
For demos and local testing, requiring a queue worker running adds unnecessary friction. Using `dispatchSync()` executes jobs immediately inline, making it trivial to see live dashboard updates without additional setup.

#### Status Variety
The 14 statuses cover common states across different OS build systems (Windows, Linux, macOS, FreeBSD) to make demos more realistic and showcase the flexible status field design.

### Commands to Remember

```bash
# Simulate 5 random machine updates (default)
lando artisan app:simulate-api-updates

# Simulate 10 random machine updates
lando artisan app:simulate-api-updates --number=10

# Useful for quickly demonstrating live dashboard updates without API calls or queue workers
```

## Session Summary (2025-10-06)

### What We Accomplished

1. **Code Review & Refactoring**
   - Added missing return types to model relationships
   - Added missing `$fillable` properties to Lab and Log models
   - Refactored MachineUpdate job to use `array_filter()` with null coalescing operator
   - Created Form Request for API validation (moved from inline controller validation)
   - Added database indexes on `machines.name` and `machines.status` (lab_id already indexed via foreign key)

2. **Feature Enhancements**
   - Updated MachineList to load latest 10 logs for modal display
   - Added pagination to MachineDetails (50 logs per page)
   - Implemented Horizon authorization using `isAdmin()` gate

3. **Test Suite**
   - Created comprehensive Pest v4 test suite (39 tests, 89 assertions)
   - API endpoint tests with Sanctum authentication
   - Job tests covering all edge cases
   - Livewire component tests for both MachineList and MachineDetails

### Key Lessons & Best Practices

#### 1. Test Thoroughness Matters
**Issue**: Initial tests checked that updates worked but didn't verify *all* fields remained intact or that validation failures prevented job dispatch.

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive field checks in `updates existing machine` test
- Added `Queue::assertNotPushed()` to all validation failure tests
- Explicitly test that fields *don't* change when they shouldn't

**Takeaway**: Tests should tell the complete story - both what happens AND what doesn't happen. This catches unintended side effects and documents expected behavior for new developers.

#### 2. Encapsulate Authorization Logic
**Issue**: Direct column checks (`$user->is_admin`) become painful to refactor when requirements change.

**Solution**: Created `User::isAdmin(): bool` helper method.

**Rationale**: When authorization logic evolves (e.g., adding email verification checks, role relationships, etc.), you only update one method instead of hunting down dozens of column checks throughout the codebase.

#### 3. Sanctum Testing Helpers
**Discovery**: `Sanctum::actingAs(User::factory()->create(), ['*'])` is much cleaner than creating tokens and passing Authorization headers.

**Benefit**: Reduces test boilerplate significantly and makes intent clearer.

#### 4. Don't Test Framework Code
**Principle**: We shouldn't test that Livewire pagination works (Caleb Porzio already did that). We should test:
- That pagination UI appears when expected (50+ logs)
- Our business logic (ordering, filtering, data display)
- Our configuration (50 per page)

#### 5. Explicit UI Elements for Testing
**Note**: For thorough testing of null/optional fields, consider adding explicit UI elements (like badges with IDs) that show "N/A" or specific states. Makes tests more reliable than just checking absence of text.

#### 6. MySQL Foreign Key Indexes
**Discovery**: MySQL/InnoDB automatically creates indexes on foreign key columns, so we don't need to manually add them.

### Tools That Helped

#### Laravel Boost MCP Server
The Laravel Boost MCP tool was invaluable for:
- Finding version-specific documentation (Pest 4, Sanctum testing, Horizon authorization)
- Searching across multiple Laravel ecosystem packages simultaneously
- Getting exact code examples for our installed package versions

Particularly helpful for:
- Sanctum `actingAs()` pattern for testing
- Horizon `viewHorizon` gate authorization
- Livewire 3 testing patterns

### Architecture Decisions

#### Status Field
Currently a free-form string to accommodate different OS build systems (Windows, Linux, macOS, FreeBSD). May evolve to enum later once we understand all possible values.

#### Lab Auto-Creation
Labs are auto-created via `firstOrCreate()` because:
- Multiple labs with varying naming conventions
- Labs split/merge over time
- Local teams know ground truth
- No central lab registry

Alternative considered: Pre-defined labs with validation. Rejected for PoC due to organizational complexity.

#### Logs Storage
Currently storing all machine update logs as JSON. Future considerations:
- Add retention policy (time-based or count-based)
- Consider storing only deltas rather than full state
- May need log pagination/archiving at scale

### Test Organization

```
tests/
├── Feature/
│   ├── Api/
│   │   └── MachineUpdateControllerTest.php (8 tests - auth, validation, queuing)
│   ├── Jobs/
│   │   └── MachineUpdateTest.php (8 tests - CRUD, lab handling, logs)
│   └── Livewire/
│       ├── MachineListTest.php (15 tests - display, filtering, pagination)
│       └── MachineDetailsTest.php (7 tests - display, logs, routing)
└── Unit/
```

**Total**: 39 tests, 89 assertions

### Commands to Remember

```bash
# Run all tests
lando php artisan test

# Run specific test file
lando php artisan test --filter=MachineUpdateTest

# Refresh database with new indexes
lando php artisan migrate:fresh
```

### Next Steps (Future Sessions)

1. Implement `SimulateApiUpdates` command for local testing
2. Add more feature tests as new functionality is added
3. Consider adding browser tests (Dusk/Playwright) for critical user flows
4. Implement log retention policy
5. Add more admin features using `isAdmin()` gate

### Notes for Future Developers

- **Don't rush to enum**: Status field is intentionally flexible until we know all possible values across different OS build systems
- **Test negative cases**: Always verify that failures/validation errors have the expected side effects (or lack thereof)
- **Use factories**: All test data should come from factories, even in simple scenarios
- **Queue::fake() vs Bus::fake()**: We prefer `Queue::fake()` for testing queued jobs as it's more semantically correct

### Patterns to Follow

1. **Form Requests for API validation** - Keeps controllers thin
2. **Return types on relationships** - Makes IDE autocomplete work better
3. **Explicit `$fillable` arrays** - Even if "obvious", be explicit
4. **Helper methods for authorization** - `isAdmin()` instead of `$user->is_admin`
5. **Test thoroughness** - Check all fields, not just the ones that changed
6. **Negative assertions** - Test that things DON'T happen when they shouldn't
